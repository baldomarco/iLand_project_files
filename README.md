# iLand_project_files
This repository is used for store and share the forest landscape and disturbance model (https://iland-model.org/startpage) simulations realised in the Kostelec forest landscape area in the Cz case study.


# iLand_forest_management
iLand forest management is a repository in which are published the javascript codes for the implementation of the forest management into the forest landscape and disturbance model - iLand https://iland-model.org/startpage. In particular here are published the JS realised for the CZ case study in Kostelec sorrounding forests.

Simulation testes and design for the "Climate change and browsing by ungulates drive species composition of Central European forests" first CZ, Kostelec forest landscape example!
